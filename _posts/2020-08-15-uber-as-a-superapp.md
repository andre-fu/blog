title: Uber as a western super app - reality or impossibility? 
---


Recently, I was listening to the Business Casual podcast (highly recommended!), where the host interviewed Connie Chan, a partner at the famous Venture Capital (VC) firm Andreesen Horowitz. Chan correctly pointed out that Asian trends are ahead of Western ones by 3-5 years and showed WeChat as a notable example. She then mentioned that Uber is best positioned to become the WeChat of the west. While this is a bold claim to make, I see Chan’s logic in asserting Uber as the WeChat of the west due to their large user base & embedded payments. That being said, *I believe that Uber can’t serve as a viable choice for a western super-app due to its inability to scale to user social needs. Consequently,I believe the largest competitors to WeChat will be from Facebook & Apple.*



Let’s back up a bit here & set the stage. WeChat is a multi-use app and platform created by Chinese monolith Tencent. Its features include messaging, payments, shopping, news amongst a dozen other features that users can peruse and access at a moment’s notice. That’s the definition of a super app - an app where the user can use the plethora of services offered for everything - from payments to shopping to interacting with their friends. An incredibly popular app, it reached 1.2b monthly active users (MAU) [1] in the first quarter of 2020. With a 7th of the world claimed as users, it wields an incredible power in terms of data and influence. So how did WeChat become so popular? It started as a messaging app in 2010 when it split from the PC-era MSN style messaging system was Tencent was developing. Within 2 years it reached 300m registered users & was poised to surpass Weibo as China’s most popular messaging app. In 2013, WeChat added payments and partnered with Chinese vendors to accept WeChat wallet, solidifying its place in the embedded payments space. Over the next few years, it iterated their product and launched new features like taxi-hailing, mobile shopping and cash transfers [2] further encouraging users to stay in-app. 



WeChat’s prominence in Asian markets is due to its ability to create ‘stickiness’ within the app. Shan Shen wrote a blog post where she isolated two main reasons why WeChat is so successful [3]. The first reason is because it created an integrated experience for browsing: imagine if you combined the time spent on Reddit, Instagram and Facebook into one app! The second reason is a content-driven platform for shopping. Shen points to the seamless experience, transitioning from *looking* at a news article to buying that pair of shoes in the ad, as a driver behind WeChat’s success. The main thing Shen is missing is the social aspect of WeChat which makes it so incredibly successful. Users will keep coming back to the app for their messaging and social media - connecting with their friends is a vital part of how WeChat maintains its users. From there, WeChat pushes browsing news and one-click shopping thus enabling a cycle of users getting deeper into the app.



Like Chan, multiple prominent tech sources (CNBC, FT, Forbes, CNET - see sources)  also believe Uber is poised to be the new super app of the west. In the last few years Uber has moved from black-car and generic ride hailing into food delivery and now groceries. Their recent (to-be) acquisition of Postmates (food delivery) and Cornerstore (grocery delivery) showcases Uber’s determination to move into the delivery market. With 103m monthly active platform consumers (MAPCs) and 71% of the ride sharing market [4] being taken by Uber, they have a strong user base in the west in order to satisfy the demand for ride-sharing. 
The Financial Times isolates two main reasons why Uber can be the newest super app, namely their strong user base and their embedded payments in-app that already has significant usage (think UberEats) [5] . From here we can see what Chan was talking about - Uber’s prominence in the west as synonymous with ride-sharing and then UberEats eating into the food delivery space demonstrates their determination to be the one-stop app for those things. Furthermore, Uber’s Chief product officer wants it to be “the operating system for your daily life” reinforcing the idea that Uber’s long term goal is to dominate this space. 



The difference between Uber’s determination and WeChat’s success is twofold. Firstly, while Uber holds a strong market hold in the ridesharing space, they’re entirely VC funded, having only recently IPO’d. They have never posted a profit in the 11 years they have existed and have taken a large loss due to COVID - seeing their rides fall by 80% and UberEats deliveries go up by 50% [6]. COVID only exacerbated an ongoing issue at Uber, the fact that they compete in a space where the goal is a winner-take-all market share by reducing prices to a lower-than-profitable model. With so many competitors in ridesharing (namely Lyft) and in food delivery (Foodora, Skip the dishes, etc)  their focus is on being a market dominator and their ability to successfully launch a super app is dubious. The second reason I suspect Uber isn’t a viable option to rival WeChat in the west is due to its lack of any social features. Think about when you use Amazon, you don’t go to Amazon in your spare time, looking for something to buy, but rather enter the site because you have a specific purchase in mind! Similar to Amazon, Uber users enter the app because they have a specific purpose - either ordering delivery or getting a ride. This gap between why users enter the app is the crux of why Uber can’t parallel WeChat’s success - the users aren’t actively engaged on the app itself. Contrary to Uber, WeChat’s success is derived from its start as a messaging platform - when your friends are on the platform, it makes you want to stay. As such, I don’t believe Uber has the ability to bridge the social gap to encourage consistent usage within the app, and consequently can’t parallel WeChat’s super app model in the west.



We can now see that there are actually four requirements for a platform to become a super app - a strong user base, embedded payments, dominated market and a reason for users to stay in-app. Uber faces two gaps to be a super app - the competition to dominate their markets and their lack of a reason for users to stay in-app. There are two established players that can effortlessly fill those gaps and serve as viable alternatives to Uber as western super apps - Facebook and Apple. 



Facebook dominates the social media landscape with 2.6b MAU and 1.73b DAU, giving it access to a large user base. Furthermore, it currently reigns as the #1 social media app, fully covering the social media landscape, and the social aspect of Facebook means that users stay in-app for longer. On the other hand, Facebook faces a much smaller issue than Uber, the lack of users using embedded payments. That being said, FB has been creating an environment where embedded payments can thrive using FB marketplace and FB gaming, as arenas of wallets through FB pay (a novel system rolled out in November 2019) [8]. Consequently, the large strides facebook is making showcases how small a jump it would be for facebook to become the western super app. 



Apple has a different approach to the ‘super app’ concept by creating a super ecosystem where users feel the seamless integration of Apple products. It starts with iMessage which forces Apple users together (I know I got an iPhone because of iMessage) from there the cohesion between apps, Apple Pay, and iMessage drives users to use Apple apps and products even more. An example of this is a friend asking you for an Uber, where you can go to Apple maps and it has localized the address from your messages then you can pay your friend via Apple pay on iMessage. This simple cohesion is reinforced by the fact these systems are defaults on Apple leading higher user usage. Apple satisfies the 4 requirements by having 1b Apple product users [9], market dominance in the west is complimented by their market share of 45% of all smartphone users in the US, Apple pay satisfies embedded payments and being the default system on Apple products causes users to stay in-ecosystem. Consequently, Apple is also better poised to become a super ecosystem opposed to a super app and is a more viable alternative than Uber to be a western super ‘app’. 



WeChat’s asian prominence is driven in part by its large user base and it’s embedded payments but I propose the real crux of their success is their market domination and the social aspect to WeChat. Those four keys are the recipes to a successful super app and Uber is lacking market domination and social integration. Consequently, I believe that prominent tech enthusiasts and venture capitalists like Connie Chan were incorrect to distinguish Uber as the western super-app-to-be. I then highlight Facebook and Apple as two alternative platforms that can pose as viable super apps in the near future.
