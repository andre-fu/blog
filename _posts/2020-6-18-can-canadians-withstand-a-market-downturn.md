Can Canadians withstand a market downturn? 

Short Answer: In my limited opinion, No. 

Long answer: No, & here’s why. 

Cheap Credit had enabled Canadians to over-leverage themselves against their homes, which due to COVID-19 will decrease in price causing defaults.

Since 1992, there has been an overall decline in cheap credit [1] and over this time, Canadians have been increasing consumer spending [2]. The link between cheap credit and increased consumer spending is no accident, as credit becomes cheaper so does the ability for Canadians to spend it [3] . The Bank of Canada now estimates that close to 65% of the TOTAL spending in Canada is due to consumer spending, meaning that this spending ends up being a large driver to the Canadian Economy [4]. Prior to January 2020, the average ratio of household spending to disposable income was close to 173% [5] . This increase has been increasing at approximately the same rate as the consumer spending in Canada, tying the increase in consumer spending to the average Canadian being in debt by almost double their disposable income. It’s unequivocally evident that Canadians’ access to cheap credit has led them to get into so much debt. 


The question isn’t the availability of the credit, but rather it’s source. Where has this large availability in credit come from? Most consumer spending on daily purchases are expended to a credit card, but with almost double their debt to disposable income, what's the source of this large credit? Such large purchases could never fit on the average credit limit of $8k [6].  Enter, Home Equity Line of Credits (HELOCs), a type of line of credit that allows Canadians to leverage their homes as the collateral when taking out a line of credit. The Bank of Canada acknowledges this fact [4] as they comment that the upward trend in debt-to-income ratio. Equity extraction is a large market of the Canadian economy, comprising $89 Billion in 2017, with 48% being relegated to HELOCs and 40.3% in Mortgage refinancing in 2017. Equity extraction in this form can be a positive to the economy as a whole if leveraged correctly but 22% being put into investments and another quarter being put towards general consumption with only a quarter for home renovations & 28% to debt consolidation [7]. This implied that the spending from HELOCs isn’t going to improve the total equity in their homes but rather additional sources that aren’t contributing to strong economic sense. Recently, RBC released their 2020 Q2 results, showing this one bank had $38b in uninsured HELOC loans with 36 bps in 90+ days past due [8]. As such, it's becoming more evident that Canadians have had access to cheap credit for a while, which has driven strong economic activity, including increased household spending causing increasing household & consumer debt with a substantial portion of which coming from their home equity. 


The ability for Canadians to leverage themselves against their homes is no accident of course. The rise in Canadian housing prices in the last 30 years is a major factor in Canadians being able to extract equity from their homes. The Bank of Canada recognized this vulnerability which was a major factor in rising overnight interest rates, which was intended to increase the quality of mortgages. In May 2019, the Bank of Canada acknowledged that raising rates was taking effect, but still remained a key vulnerability [9]. Fascinatingly, they predicted the largest risks to the Canadian economy were a  “sharp repricing of financial markets” and a  “large housing price correction” [9] . During the ‘corornaconomy’ we  experienced one of those risks – an extreme drop of financial markets in mid-march 2020. According to the CMHC, the second risk is going to be experienced by Canadians later this year to mid 2021. Canadians will experience a “historic recession” due to COVID-19, implying that housing prices are going to experience a severe price correction on a 9-18% decline in the second half of 2020, with a potential increase back in 2021 [10]. The actual sales may decrease by 51-75% along the same time period. Critics of the CMHC, RE/MAX have stated the converse, that the coronavirus doesn’t “necessarily mean prices will fall” but it’s vital we acknowledge CMHC’s role as a neutral Crown Corporation and RE/MAX’s own financial interest in an inflated market [11]. 


So, what does this mean for those heavily indebted Canadian population, with large lines on credits depending on inflated housing prices? This housing drop that the CMHC predicts, has a serious potential to affect the HELOCs that were being issued in an inflated market. Either way, now Canadians have to pay back large lines of credits with a lower valued collateral (implying higher interest fees as most HELOCs have floating rates) while managing the additional stress of mortgages, bills, not forgetting the fact these households are also heavily indebted and are suffering job threats/losses due to COVID-19. Consequently, I posit that Canadians may not be able to endure the COVID-19 storm, and we may see an increase in defaults, late payments & bankruptcies by late 2020 to late 2021.
