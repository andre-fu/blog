# A little more about me! 

My name is Andre Fu, I'm a third year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto. I plan on specializing in machine intelligence.

### Interests
I'm particularly interested in software engineering and applications of machine learning to different domains. While those are my academic interets I'm also particularly interested in writing about politics, ethics, philosophy & general thoughts. 

I might occasionally write about a particularly interesting problem that I found or a new algorithm I was fooling around with. 


### Contact, Comments & Criticism! 

If you found my blog, in any way useful, distasteful, ugly, horrendous, ridiculous, outrageous, not-useful, stupid, dumb, interesting, ... [insert any adjective]... please feel free to contact me! I'm always open to criticism of any sort!
